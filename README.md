This light event management app had three key screens: login, update event, and add event. The primary goal was to provide users with a simple and intuitive platform to track and manage their light events effectively. The app addressed user needs by allowing event organizers to log in securely, update existing events with relevant information, and add new events to the system. This functionality aimed to enhance user convenience, organization, and overall efficiency in managing light events.

To support these user needs and ensure a user-centered UI, the three screens were carefully designed. The login screen provided a secure and accessible entry point. The update event screen allowed for easy modification of event details, and the add event screen facilitated the seamless addition of new events. UI designs prioritized simplicity, clarity, and ease of navigation, considering the diverse user base involved in event management. The success of these designs can be attributed to their user-centric approach, ensuring that users could interact with the app intuitively, enhancing the overall user experience.

In the coding process, I adopted a modular and scalable approach. Leveraging technologies like React Native allowed for cross-platform compatibility, reducing development time and effort. Additionally, I implemented robust authentication mechanisms to ensure the security of user data. Testing played a crucial role in ensuring functional code. Comprehensive unit tests and end-to-end tests were conducted to identify and address any issues. This process is essential to guarantee a reliable and bug-free application, meeting the user's expectations and providing a positive experience.

Throughout the app design and development process, innovation was required to overcome the challenge of accommodating diverse user needs within a simplified interface. Balancing functionality with simplicity demanded creative solutions, such as incorporating smart defaults and providing contextual guidance within the app. This innovation contributed to a more streamlined and user-friendly experience.

In terms of showcasing knowledge, skills, and experience, the authentication and data management components of the mobile app were particularly successful. Implementing secure login functionalities and efficient data handling demonstrated a deep understanding of key app development principles, contributing to the overall success of the project.
